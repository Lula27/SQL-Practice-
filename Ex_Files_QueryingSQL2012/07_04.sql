-- Define the CTE (Common Table Expression) expression name and column 
-- list.
-- Here we are naming our CTE as Sales_CTE 
-- and we are defining the column names it 
-- will use when referenced in a query later.

-- This is the query that generates the 
-- structure of the CTE and returns the data 
--values that will be contained in the CTE.

    SELECT SalesPersonID, SalesOrderID, 
		YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE SalesPersonID IS NOT NULL
)


-- Now that the inner query has been created, 
-- we can define the CTE outer query that 
-- will use the result set from the previous 
-- query.
-- Note that the previous query can execute 
-- by itself, but this query will generate an 
-- error if you execute it alone, 
-- demonstrating that the CTE
-- only exists in the scope of the entire 
-- query operation
