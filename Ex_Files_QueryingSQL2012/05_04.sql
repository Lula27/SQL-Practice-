-- Return all the rows in the Address table to 
-- see what the actual row count is.  We will 
-- compare this with the next query that uses the 
-- TOP keyword to return a specified 
-- number of rows
SELECT *
FROM Person.Address; 
GO


-- Return the TOP 20 rows in the Address table 
-- including all fields
SELECT TOP 20 * 
FROM Person.Address; 
GO


-- Return the TOP 20 rows in the Address table but 
-- only include the AddressID and City fields to 
-- see that you don't need to return all the 
-- fields in the table and that the SELECT 
-- statement is the same as any other, with the 
-- exception of using the TOP clause.
-- Also notice the difference in the returned 
-- records from the previous query using TOP.
-- Order changes - not necesarily ordered 
SELECT TOP 20 AddressID, City
FROM Person.Address; 
GO



-- Return the TOP 20 percent of rows in the 
-- Address table including all fields.
-- Note the row count and compare it to the 
-- total row count of 19614 rows.
-- 3923 is 20% of 19,614
-- Gives top 20% of total record count within table itself
SELECT TOP 20 PERCENT AddressID, City
FROM Person.Address;
GO 



-- Use the ORDER BY clause to change the returned 
-- records by looking for the highest tax rates 
-- in the SalesTaxRate table.  ORDER BY must be 
-- used to control the returned results.  
-- In this case, we choose descending to get the 
-- highest tax rates in the table and sort from 
-- highest to lowest.
-- WITH TIES = includes duplicates (ties = 14.25) 
SELECT TOP (10) WITH TIES TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
GO 


-- Use the ORDER BY clause again but this time, 
-- do not indicate a sort order
-- instead relying on the default ascending order
-- Notice SQL completly changed previous query, no additional process done
SELECT TOP (10) TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate;
GO 




-- Use the ORDER BY clause to change the returned 
-- records by looking for the highest tax rates 
-- in the SalesTaxRate table.  ORDER BY must be 
-- used to control the returned results.  In this 
-- case, we choose descending to get the highest 
-- tax rates in the table and sort from highest to 
-- lowest.
-- We also choose to return 20 rows to demonstrate 
-- the use of WITH TIES which tells SQL we want to 
-- include values that are tied, as in this case
-- the tax rate of $7.00.  This results in more 
-- than 20 records returned however to represent 
-- the tied values.
-- Retreives 27 rows because includes duplicate values 
SELECT TOP (20) WITH TIES TaxRate 
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC; 
GO 

-- Include ORDER BY or else sql will just return top (x) randomly
