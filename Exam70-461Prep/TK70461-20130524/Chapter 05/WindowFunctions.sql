---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- partitioning

-- returning detail as well as aggregates
SELECT custid, orderid, 
  val,
  SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY custid) AS custtotal,
  SUM(val) OVER() AS grandtotal
FROM Sales.OrderValues;

-- computing percents of detail out of aggregates
SELECT custid, orderid, 
  val,
  CAST(100.0 * val / SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY custid) AS NUMERIC(5, 2)) AS pctcust,
  CAST(100.0 * val / SUM(val) OVER()                    AS NUMERIC(5, 2)) AS pcttotal
FROM Sales.OrderValues;

-- framing

-- computing running total
SELECT custid, orderid, orderdate, val,
  SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY custid
                ORDER BY orderdate, orderid
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
                         AND CURRENT ROW) AS runningtotal

-- filter running totals that are less than 1000.00
WITH RunningTotals AS

-- Window Ranking Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT custid, orderid, val,

-- LAG and LEAD retrieving values from previous and next rows
SELECT custid, orderid, orderdate, val,

                 ORDER BY orderdate, orderid) AS prev_val,

                 ORDER BY orderdate, orderid) AS next_val
FROM Sales.OrderValues;

-- FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE retrieving values from first and last rows in frame
SELECT custid, orderid, orderdate, val,
  FIRST_VALUE(val)  OVER(PARTITION BY custid
                         ORDER BY orderdate, orderid
                         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
